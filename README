Project Description: 
This project is intended to act as a simulation of trains that switch cars with eachother and keep a total number of points for each train.
The trains (the class Dequeue) are made up cars (a structure called node that holds a data value and has pointers that points to the node that is infront of it and to the node that is behind it).
The simulation takes command line paramaters called n, c, and t. 
Each train will contain a total value based on the number of cars it has. 
Throughout the simulation the randGen.pl random number generator will tell the simulation which train will donate a car and which train will recieve a car.
Once a train has zero cars left or the appropriate amount of steps has been reached the simulation will stop.

Expected input: 
The program expects the randGen.pl file with the piping operator (|) to pipe random numbers into the simulation. 
The program also expects 3 command line paramaters: n, c, and t. 
Where n is the number of trains, c is the number of cars, and t is the number of steps the program is allowed to go to. 
N, c, and t should all be integers that are greater than zero. 

Expected output: 
The program will output which train donates a car, if the car came from the front or the back of the train, which train recieves the donated car, and the values of each train at each step. 
At the end of the simulation the winner of the simulation, and why the simulation ended will be outputted.

How to Compile: 
To compile the program enter: make run
